## Project: WildWatch
Welcome aboard fellow animal lover! We are really excited to have you here! ðŸ˜‰  
Wildwatch is a program for a clerk managing wildlife data in a wildlife reserve via the Command Line Interface (CLI).  
The purpose of this user guide is to familiarize you with the program and help you when you face a problem using it.  
Its main job is to store and present animal data, this would make your job so much more convenient!
