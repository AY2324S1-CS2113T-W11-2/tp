## Introduction üêª

Wildwatch is a program for a clerk managing wildlife data in a wildlife reserve via the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://ay2324s1-cs2113t-w11-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#glossary).  
Its main job is to store and present animal data required in everyday operations of the wildlife reserve.  

### Purpose
This document specifies the architectural and software design decisions in the implementation of the WildWatch.

### Audience
The intended audience for this document are developers who would like to look under the hood and understand how WildWatch works, and are looking to introduce new functionalities into WildWatch.

## Quick Start üêµ

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer. (What is my [Java version](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html)?)
   
2. Download the latest `WildWatch.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your WildWatch.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and run the following command: `java -jar WildWatch.jar`.
You should see the welcome screen as the diagram below.

5. Type commands below the horizontal line and press `Enter` to execute it. (e.g. typing `help` and pressing `Enter` will show the help page).
Some example commands you can try:
- `list` : Lists all entries.  
- `bye` : Exits the program.

## Design & Implementation

### System Architecture

![System Architecture](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/7bdda637-1c7a-4358-a648-a9972184cd3d)

The **_Architecture Diagram_** above explains the high-level design of the application.  
WildWatch is comprised of 7 major components.  
- `Main`: Entry point of the program.
- `UI`: A class that receives input from, and prints output to the user.
- `Parser`: A class that processes and interpretes the input command of the user.
- `Command`: A set of classes that does specific task according to the command of the user.
- `EntryList`: A class that stores all the wildlife data, while the program is running.
- `Entry`: A class that stores individual wildlife data, while the program is running.
- `FileHandler`: A class that saves and retrieves all the wildlife data from the local storage
