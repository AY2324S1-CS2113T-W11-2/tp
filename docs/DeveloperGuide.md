## Introduction üêª

Welcome aboard fellow animal lover! We are really excited to have you here! üòâ    
Wildwatch is a program for a clerk managing wildlife data in a wildlife reserve via the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://ay2324s1-cs2113t-w11-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#glossary-).  
Its main job is to store and present animal data required in everyday operations of the wildlife reserve.  

### Purpose
This document specifies the architectural and software design decisions in the implementation of the WildWatch.  
For a detailed guide on how to use the program and explanations on the individual commands, we have our very own [**WildWatch User Guide**](https://ay2324s1-cs2113t-w11-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html) for your perusal.

## Quick Start üêµ

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer. (What is my [Java version](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html)?)
   
2. Download the latest `WildWatch.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your WildWatch.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and run the following command: `java -jar WildWatch.jar`.
You should see the welcome screen as the diagram below.

5. Type commands beside `>>>` below the horizontal line and press `Enter` to execute it. Some example commands you can try:
- `help` : Shows the help page.  
- `bye` : Exits the program.  

```

## Design & Implementation üêπ

### System Architecture

![System Architecture](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/90309a3c-f784-4ffb-8eef-65735c05ec52)

The **_Architecture Diagram_** above shows a high-level overview of the architectural design of WildWatch.  
Actual detailed implementation may differ from the architectural diagram.  
(e.g., `Parser` in the diagram encompasses the `Execute`, `Error`, and `Parser` packages).  
  
WildWatch is comprised of 7 major components.  
- `Main`: Entry point of the program.
- `UI`: A class that receives input from, and prints output to the user.
- `Parser`: A class that processes and interpretes the input command of the user.
- `Command`: A set of classes that does specific task according to the command of the user.
- `EntryList`: A class that stores all the wildlife data, while the program is running.
- `Entry`: A class that stores individual wildlife data, while the program is running.
- `Storage`: A class that saves and retrieves all the wildlife data from the local storage
  
![General Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/6cef0c5a-c924-4f20-bf82-3ccee9eb61c0)  
 
The **_Generic Sequence Diagram_** above shows how the components in the architecture interact with each other for a generic command input in WildWatch.  
> ‚úè Note: `Command` here is a placeholder, and will be replaced by actual commands. e.g., `ListCommand`.

### Main Component  
The `Main` component, residing as a method in the `WildWatch` class, which is the only class without a package, is the entry point of the program.  
  
![Main Class Diagram](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/2745b29a-da1d-423e-b460-10f65dbc8e0d)  
  
### UI Package  
The `UI` components can be found within the `UI` package.  
It prompts and reads commands from the user and sends the command to `Execute` package to be executed.  
Lastly, it prints an output message upon completion of the command, to show the success of failure of the command execution.  
  
![UI Class Diagram](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/d44324ea-ca0a-4094-8082-32ddafc7e694)  
  
### Parser Package 
The `Parser` components can be found within the `Parser` package.  
It is responsible for parsing the input String of the user, and returning an appropriate `XYZCommand` class.  
If the input is invalid, it throws exceptions to the `Error` package for error handling.  
The **_Parser Class Diagram_** below shows how `Execute`, `Parser`, `Error`, `Command` classes of their respective packages work together.  
  
![Parser Class Diagram](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/1c8a8ae1-a14d-427f-8ecd-aa5038fb4fc7)
  
### Command Package  
The `Command` components can be found within the `Command` package.

## Product scope ü¶Å

### Target user profile

Target user profile for WildWatch is the clerks working in wildlife reserves, who manages the wildlife data.
Since our program is interacted through the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://ay2324s1-cs2113t-w11-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#glossary-), someone who can type fast will definitely benefit from WildWatch.
This would significantly boost one's productivity.
Since clerks are already accustomed to typing and working with a computer, this program would be ideal for this user profile.
