## Introduction

### Purpose
This document specifies the architectural and software design decisions in the implementation of the WildWatch.

### Audience
The intended audience for this document are developers who would like to look under the hood and understand how WildWatch works, and are looking to introduce new functionalities into WildWatch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer. (What is my [Java version](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html)?)
   
2. Download the latest `WildWatch.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your WildWatch.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and run the following command: `java -jar WildWatch.jar`.
You should see the welcome screen as the diagram below.

5. Type commands below the horizontal line and press `Enter` to execute it. (e.g. typing `help` and pressing `Enter` will show the help page).
Some example commands you can try:
- `list` : Lists all entries.  
- `bye` : Exits the program.

## Design & Implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

Wildwatch is a program for a clerk managing wildlife data in a wildlife reserve via the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://ay2324s1-cs2113t-w11-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#glossary).


## Product scope
### Target user profile

Target user profile are the clerks working in zoos.


### Value proposition

{Describe the value proposition: what problem does it solve?}
