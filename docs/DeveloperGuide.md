## Introduction üêª

Welcome aboard fellow animal lover! We are really excited to have you here! üòâ    
Wildwatch is a program for a clerk managing wildlife data in a wildlife reserve via the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary-).  
Its main job is to store and present animal data required in everyday operations of the wildlife reserve.  

### Purpose
This document specifies the architectural and software design decisions in the implementation of the WildWatch.  
For a detailed guide on how to use the program and explanations on the individual commands, we have our very own [**WildWatch User Guide**](https://ay2324s1-cs2113t-w11-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html) for your perusal.

### Audience
The intended audience for this document are developers who would like to look under the hood and understand how WildWatch works, and are looking to introduce new functionalities into WildWatch.

## Quick Start üêµ

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer. (What is my [Java version](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html)?)
   
2. Download the latest `WildWatch.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your WildWatch.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and run the following command: `java -jar WildWatch.jar`.
You should see the welcome screen as the diagram below.

5. Type commands beside `>>>` below the horizontal line and press `Enter` to execute it. Some example commands you can try:
- `help` : Shows the help page.  
- `bye` : Exits the program.  

```

## Design & Implementation üêπ

### System Architecture

![System Architecture](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/90309a3c-f784-4ffb-8eef-65735c05ec52)

The **_Architecture Diagram_** above shows a high-level overview of the architectural design of WildWatch.  
Actual detailed implementation may differ from the architectural diagram.  
(e.g., `Parser` in the diagram encompasses the `Execute`, `Error`, and `Parser` packages).  
  
WildWatch is comprised of 7 major components.  
- `Main`: Entry point of the program.
- `UI`: A class that receives input from, and prints output to the user.
- `Parser`: A class that processes and interpretes the input command of the user.
- `Command`: A set of classes that does specific task according to the command of the user.
- `EntryList`: A class that stores all the wildlife data, while the program is running.
- `Entry`: A class that stores individual wildlife data, while the program is running.
- `Storage`: A class that saves and retrieves all the wildlife data from the local storage
  
![General Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/6cef0c5a-c924-4f20-bf82-3ccee9eb61c0)  
 
The **_Generic Sequence Diagram_** above shows how the components in the architecture interact with each other for a generic command input in WildWatch.  
> ‚úè Note: `Command` here is a placeholder, and will be replaced by actual commands. e.g., `ListCommand`.

### Main Component  
The `Main` component, residing as a method in the `WildWatch` class, which is the only class without a package, is the entry point of the program.  
  
![Main Class Diagram](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/2745b29a-da1d-423e-b460-10f65dbc8e0d)  
  
### UI Package  
The `UI` components can be found within the `UI` package.  
It prompts and reads commands from the user and sends the command to `Execute` package to be executed.  
Lastly, it prints an output message upon completion of the command, to show the success of failure of the command execution.  
  
![UI Class Diagram](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/d44324ea-ca0a-4094-8082-32ddafc7e694)  
  
### Parser Package 
The `Parser` components can be found within the `Parser` package.  
It is responsible for parsing the input String of the user, and returning an appropriate `XYZCommand` class.  
If the input is invalid, it throws exceptions to the `Error` package for error handling.  
The **_Parser Class Diagram_** below shows how `Execute`, `Parser`, `Error`, `Command` classes of their respective packages work together.  
  
![Parser Class Diagram](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/1c8a8ae1-a14d-427f-8ecd-aa5038fb4fc7)
  
### Command Package  
The `Command` components can be found within the `Command` package.

### EntryList Package  
The `EntryList` class can be found within the `Entry` package.

### Entry Package  
The `Entry` class can be found within the `Entry` package.

The class diagram above shows the relationship beteen the `Entry`, `EntryList`, and `ArrayList` classes.

## Product scope ü¶Å

### Target user profile

Target user profile for WildWatch is the clerks working in wildlife reserves, who manages the wildlife data.
Since our program is interacted through the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary-), someone who can type fast will definitely benefit from WildWatch.
This would significantly boost one's productivity.
Since clerks are already accustomed to typing and working with a computer, this program would be ideal for this user profile.


### Value proposition

- **Effortless User Experience**: Designed with simplicity in mind, our product ensures that even users with minimal technical experience can easily navigate and interact with the software.
- **Rapid CLI Interaction**: Unlike traditional GUIs that require multiple clicks and drags, our Command Line Interface (CLI) offers direct command inputs, allowing for faster and more efficient operations.
- **Light & Versatile**: Built to be lean and light, our program ensures seamless performance across a variety of devices, as long as Java is installed, from high-end workstations to older laptops. Regardless of your computer's specifications, our product guarantees a smooth and efficient functioning.
- **Robust Data Protection**: Say goodbye to the vulnerabilities of paper records! Our digital solution offers enhanced data protection, ensuring your records remain safe from damage, loss, or unauthorized access. With advanced encryption and backup mechanisms in place, your data's safety is our priority.
- **Eco-Friendly**: Transition from paper to digital and contribute to a greener planet. Not only does this transition reduce clutter and the risk of loss, but it also significantly diminishes your carbon footprint.
